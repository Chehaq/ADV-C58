   <h2>  My hobby is coding apps, websites etc in my free time. Whenever I feel bored I always do coding after my homework. <br>
	   I am 10 years old and read in 5th class. Now I know well that coding helps to increase our memory,problem solving skill and cognitive skills as well. Coding exercises can activate the brain's learning centres.Coding can keep on busy, concentrated and cheerful.

  Coding is a good source of enjoyable, concentration and computer technology. It make us aware of the future, helps us in future, knowledge but most impotantly succesfull </h2>
